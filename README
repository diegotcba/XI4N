eXtensible Insim 4 Nodejs
-------------------------
A toy project to communicate with LiveForSpeed InSim servers.

Very much a work in progress. Doesn't yet support all InSim packets, OutSim, or
Outguage yet. Only supports TCP.

Features
--------
  * Can be used as library or as a standalone product
  * Supports multiple TCP InSim connections
  * Lightweight in comparison to other InSim clients

Todo
----
See TODO for the interesting ones.
Not yet a comprehensive list.

Install
-------
  - Install nodejs (if not already done)
  - Clone this repository 
  - cd xi4n
  - npm -g install .

Usage - As a platform (standalone)
----------------------------------
  * After install you will now have a xi4n command
  * To setup a base config and plugins run "xi4n -i path/to/directory"
  * Modify your config.json as necessary
  * Install/update any plugins
  * run "xi4n -c path/to/directory" to run your configuration and plugins

Usage - As a library
--------------------
Still writing the docs for this one, however as a rough outline -

  * var xi4n = require('xi4n') yields the following:
    - xi4n.insim
    - xi4n.client
    - xi4n.clientmanager
    - xi4n.logger
    - xi4n.product
  * See examples/ directory for some simple examples

Requires
--------
Uses the following awesome libraries - 
  * node-bufferlist
  * node-jspack
  * commander

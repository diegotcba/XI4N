Hacking on xi4n
===============

Patches are welcomed via Github pull request or email with unified diff.

Please feel free to add yourself to `package.json` in your patch.

We make no guarantee we'll accept the patch, but it's reasonably likely unless
it's for something as trivial as formatting.

Code Style
----------

We'd prefer it if the existing style was kept to, but we're not touchy (yet)
about tabs spaces and lines.

The only hard request is semi-colons aren't optional.

  * Finish plugins/state.js
  * Does plugins/state.js need to be an eventemitter? if not how do we
    communicate updates with other plugins that rely on it?
  * Finish plugins/livemap.js to demo posibilities
    - make it rely on a plugins/state.js, rather than dealing with it, itself
  * Add plugin dependency management to ClientManager? Somewhere else?
  * Add iconv support to deal with LFS' codepage hell that works on both win and
    everything else without compiling stuff
  * Add ButtonManager
  * Add the other packets I've not bothered to translate yet
  * Add a bundled vector library to insim.js
  * Add plugin validation checking
  * Write documentation

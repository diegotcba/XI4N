      itself
  * Add dependency management to ClientManager? Somewhere else?
  * Add iconv support to deal with LFS' codepage hell that works on both win and
    everything else without compiling stuff
  * Add ButtonManager
  * Add the other packets I've not bothered to translate yet
  * Add state management to Client
  * Add a bundled vector library to insim.js
  * Add plugin validation checking
  * Write documentation

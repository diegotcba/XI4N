  * Finish plugins/state.js
  * Finish plugins/livemap.js to demo posibilities
    - make it rely on a plugins/state.js, rather than dealing with it, itself
  * Add plugin dependency management to ClientManager? Somewhere else?
  * Change lib/strings.js to also output a usable class, that maybe used by
    IS_MSO, etc.
  * Add support for strings.js to reverse from utf8 to a codepage?
  * Add ButtonManager
  * Add the other packets I've not bothered to translate yet
  * Add a bundled vector library to insim.js
  * Add plugin validation checking
  * Write documentation

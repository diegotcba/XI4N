# eXtensible Insim 4 Nodejs

## Features
  * Can be used as library or as a standalone product
  * Supports InSim, OutSim, Outgauge and LFSW Relay (some may be more
	experimental than others)
  * Supports multiple TCP InSim connections
  * Allows for use of any existing node package in your plugin

## ACHTUNG!
  * master branch is currently under going re-write. All existing documentation
	is wrong
  * That means that the API is unstable
  * 0.1.0 is a re-architecture due to a fantastic cock up on my part, see
	changelog - older plugins may be incompatible

## Todo
See issues on github, and grep for TODO through source.
Docs need to be rewritten.

## Installation and Usage - As a platform

## Usage - As a library

## Contributing

	aware of the current master branch rewrite that invalidates some of the
	commands in the videos - these will be fixed up when API becomes stable
